DataLayerObjectGenerator
========================

Here for posterity's sake... :-)

DLOG is an old code generator that would target a SQL database and generate POCO and CRUD/Repository objects targeting the Enterprise Library.

If you're running a version of SQL server old enough to get the app to run, please forgive the gaudy UI, I was just learning WPF. :-)
